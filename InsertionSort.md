Question 2)<br>
Show the time complexity as Big O notation<br>
O(n²)

Question 3)<br>
For these, write the Time complexity; Average case: The number we're looking for is in the middle, Worst case: The number we're looking for is at the end of the array, Worst case: The number we're looking for is at the beginning of the array<br>
Average case: O(n²)<br>
Worst case: O(n²)<br>
Best case: O(n)<br>

Question 4)<br>
Which case does the number 18 fall into after the array is sorted?<br>
It falls into Average case<br>

Question 5)<br>
Write the first 4 steps of [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] according to Insertion Sort.<br>
[3, 7, 5, 8, 2, 9, 4, 15, 6]<br>
[3, 5, 7, 8, 2, 9, 4, 15, 6]<br>
[3, 5, 7, 2, 8, 9, 4, 15, 6]<br>
